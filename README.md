Illustrator scripts to generate type

<p>I created an Illustrator script that types a letter (in this case, &#8216;J&#8217; &#038; &#8216;K&#8217;) using every font installed on a computer. It aligns all the letters and then cuts slices out of each letter based on width. The collections are the results of 18 computers that friends and I tried this on. They range from 97 to 6607 fonts.</p>

<h3>If you&#8217;d like to try this on your computer:</h3>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong>

<ol class="olABC">

	<li>Adobe Illustrator CS, CS2, or CS3. <strong>If you are using CS4, please down-save the files to CS3 before sending</strong>. In the event of any error, let me know exactly what happened and I can try to debug.</li>

	<li>Some patience (amount depends on size of font collection)</li>

	<li>Willingness to <a href="mailto:website@c71123.com">e-mail me</a> the two files when you are done</li>

	<li>Acceptance that this may produce an error and not work for you the first time</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>How to use the Slitscan type generator (as verbosely as I can think) :</strong>

<ol class="olDecimal">

	<li>Download the <a href="../zip/slitscan-v1_1.zip">Slitscan zip file</a></li>

	<li>Unzip it. This will extract two files: a jpeg of what your output should look like, and a javascript file (.jsx) that Illustrator will use.</li>

	<li>Open Illustrator</li>

	<li>Go to the <em>&#8216;File&#8217;</em> Menu and choose <em>&#8216;Scripts&#8217;</em> >> <em>&#8216;Other Scripts&#8230;&#8217;</em></li>

	<li>Navigate to the unzipped javascript file titled <em>&#8216;Slitscan-v1_1.jsx&#8217;</em> and select it.</li>

	<li><strong>Wait</strong></li>

	<li>When an alert pops up telling you how many fonts Illustrator thinks you have, click &#8216;<em>OK</em>&#8216;</li>

	<li>There will be two files that remain open in Illustrator and should look similar to the jpeg file. Look at them if you feel so inclined, but don&#8217;t touch! <img src='../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  <strong>If you are using CS4, please down-save the files to CS3 before sending!</strong></li>

	<li>Close the files</li>

	<li>Navigate to your home folder or do a search for <em>&#8216;Slitscan&#8217;</em></li>

	<li>There should be two files with the prefix <em>&#8216;Slitscan-&#8217;</em> in your home folder</li>

	<li>If you can, zip or stuff them into one archive file.</li>

	<li><a href="mailto:website@c71123.com">E-mail me</a> the archive file. Please use &#8216;Slitscan&#8217; as the subject line (this way I should see it if my e-mail program labels as spam).</li>

	<li><strong>Wait again</strong></li>

	<li>I run another set of scripts on this file which will get a final result.</li>

	<li>I will e-mail you the two files back so you can have them for posterity&#8217;s sake. You are free to use them however and wherever you like as well. </li>

	<li>Bask in the warm feeling that you are a vital component of this project</li>
